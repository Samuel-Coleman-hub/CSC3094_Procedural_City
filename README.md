# Procedural City Generation (Final Year Project)

This is my final year project for my BSc Computer Science Degree, where I created a Proceduarl City Generation tool for Unity.

Within the project I researched into the current usage of procedural generation in game development and some of the algorithms currently being used.
I then went on to create my own procedural generation tool utilising algorithms such as L-Systems and improving on their implementation to to generate a proceduarl city.

I designed my tool to take a variety of parameters, so that it would give game developers the control to create a city within the vision fo their game.

A demo of the tool can be played on my itch io page [Click here to play.](https://samcoleman.itch.io/procedural-city-generator.)
